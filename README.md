## Overview

Crime analysis and prediction play a crucial role in improving public safety. By analyzing historical crime data, we can uncover patterns and trends to help law enforcement agencies make data-driven decisions. This project explores the Chicago Crime dataset, performing in-depth analysis and building machine learning models to predict and understand crime trends.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
  - Investigates the dataset for patterns and outliers.
  - Visualizes crime trends by type, time, and location.
- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Handles missing values and encodes categorical features.
  - Performs feature selection to optimize model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Implements and compares multiple ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
  - Evaluates models based on performance metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
- **Visualization:**
  - Includes heatmaps, bar charts, and other visualizations to represent findings clearly.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/), containing historical crime data such as location, type of crime, and timestamps.

### Dataset Features:
- **Primary Type:** Type of crime (e.g., theft, robbery).
- **Location Description:** Area where the crime occurred.
- **Date:** Timestamp of the crime.
- **Arrest:** Whether an arrest was made.
- **Domestic:** Indicates if the crime was domestic in nature.

### Key Insights:
* The majority of crimes occur during specific hours and in certain areas.
* Types of crimes vary by location and season.
### Model Performance:
* Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy among tested models.
* Feature importance analysis revealed key factors influencing crime predictions.

### Tools & Technologies
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* Visualization Tools: Heatmaps, Time Series Plots, Bar Graphs
* Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
